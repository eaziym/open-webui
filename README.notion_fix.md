# Notion Integration Fix

## Issues Identified

After analyzing the code, I've identified the following issues with the Notion integration:

1. **API Route Mismatch**: The client is trying to call `/api/v1/chat/completions` but the actual endpoint is `/chat/completions` (without the `/api/v1` prefix).

2. **Action Name Confusion**: The Notion integration accepts both `list_databases` and `list_notion_databases` as actions in the router, but the function definition only uses `list_notion_databases`.

3. **Error Handling**: When the Notion API returns `None` or has an error, the error format could be improved to provide more helpful instructions to users.

## How to Test

I've created a script called `call_notion_api.py` that demonstrates the correct way to call the Notion API through the chat completions endpoint.

```bash
python3 call_notion_api.py --token YOUR_JWT_TOKEN --url http://localhost:8080
```

This script:

1. Tests the direct API at `/api/v1/integrations/notion/databases` first
2. Then tests calling the function through the chat completions endpoint at `/chat/completions`
3. Provides detailed output and error messages

## Key Findings

1. The correct endpoint to use is `/chat/completions` (NOT `/api/v1/chat/completions`)
2. The function name must be `list_notion_databases` (not `list_databases`)
3. For direct API access, use `/api/v1/integrations/notion/databases`
4. Both the server-side and client-side configs need to match for this to work

## Simplified Solution for Users

If you're having trouble with the Notion integration in chat:

1. Make sure your Notion integration is connected in the Integrations page
2. Try accessing your databases directly at: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/integrations/notion/databases
3. When using the chat, make sure your request is clear: "List my Notion databases"

## Technical Notes

The root cause is that the client is sending requests to an incorrect URL path. The correct flow should be:

1. Client sends chat completion request to `/chat/completions`
2. Server processes request and recognizes Notion function call
3. Server executes Notion function and returns result
4. Client displays the result to the user

## Possible Code Fixes

If you want to fix this in your code:

1. Check your client configuration to ensure it's using the correct API endpoint
2. If you're using a custom client, make sure the API URL is configured correctly
3. The server-side code looks correct, handling both `list_databases` and `list_notion_databases`
